# Code samples for DevRel

## Exercise: 
### ü§ñ Task: 
Include code from this repository in the Google Developer Academy documentation site.

### ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Description: 
In this exercise you will each pull code from this repository using the **includecode** template tag to include snippets in our documentation site. This repository has a sample code file [`android_client.kt`](/android_client.kt) which has an example for _[Creating a Fitness API client](https://developers.google.com/fit/android/api-client-example)_ in Kotlin using the Android Fit SDK. You also have an `exercise2` folder under your devsite GDA workspace in google3 which has the iX _(information eXperience)_ document for this code sample. 

```sh
# Path to the exercise2 folder
google3_root> third_party/devsite/internal/en/experimental/gda/<USERNAME>

# Structure
exercise2
  |-- adding-snippets.md      # file you must work on
  |-- adding-snippets-sol.md  # solution file to validate your work
```

### üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Solution:

- The solution for the iX documentation changes is available in the file `adding-snippets-sol.md` under the `exercise2` directory in google3
- The solution for the source code changes is available in this repository under the git branch `answers`

---

### üòé _Your mision should you choose to accept it_:

Using the **includecode** template tag in the iX document and **region tags** in the source code file, embed the code snippets pulled from this repository in the documentation.
